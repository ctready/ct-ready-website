      <h1>I Always Carry a PC In My Pocket</h1>
      <h3>28 July 2024</h3>
      <br/>
      <p>Like many, I always have my phone on me, but sometimes I need to use a computer that isn’t mine. Whether it’s checking a flight status while traveling, downloading an important document on a colleagues computer, or using a computer with outdated antivirus, my USB flash drives are my go-to solution for comfort and security.</p>
      <p>I carry two USB flash drives: a 128GB flash drive on my key chain and a 64GB flash drive shaped like a credit card in my wallet.</p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Key Chain Flash Drive</h2>
      <p>My 128GB USB 3.0 key chain flash drive is durable and stores:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>A folder of personal identification and important documents (encrypted with VeraCrypt)</li>
	<li>A suite of portable apps for Windows (.exe) and Linux (.AppImage)</li>
	<li>Various Linux distributions for live booting</li>
	<li>General file storage and transfer</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <h2>Encrypted Folder</h2>
      <p>I keep copies of my license, passport, and other important documents in an encrypted folder using <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html" target="_blank">VeraCrypt</a>. VeraCrypt is a free, open-source program for creating encrypted drives, available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It’s crucial to keep a copy of VeraCrypt on the flash drive for access on any computer.</p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Portable Apps</h2>
      <p>Portable apps run without installation, providing security and convenience on any system. I use <a href="https://portableapps.com/" target="_blank"> portableapps.com</a> for free downloads, including:</p>
      <p>- 7zip, Audacity, Rufus, Solitaire, Firefox, Foxit, Calibre, GIMP, VIM, LibreOffice, VLC, and VeraCrypt</p>
      <p>These apps are .exe files for Windows, but I also have .AppImage files for Linux, as some distributions lack Wine, which is needed to run .exe files on Linux. For Mac, I usually boot into a live Linux distribution.</p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Live Linux Distributions</h2>
      <p>I prefer Linux for its speed, power, and versatility. I carry:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde/download" target="_blank">Fedora-KDE</a> for general use</li>
	<li><a href="https://archbang.org/download/" target="_blank">Archbang</a> for low-power modern machines</li>
	<li><a href="https://rockedge.org/kernels/data/ISO/F96-CE/" target="_blank">Puppy Linux</a> for old machines</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-live" target="_blank">Kali Linux</a> for network and security tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I can boot into a full version of any of these distributions on any available computer right from the USB.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html" target="_blank">Ventoy</a> helps me manage multiple .iso files and other files on a single bootable flash drive.</p>
      <br/>
      <h2>General File Storage and Transfer</h2>
      <p>Even with all the above, I use less than half the space on my key chain flash drive, leaving plenty for general file storage and transfer.</p>
      <br/>
      <h2>USB Credit Card Flash Drive</h2>
      <p>For times when I don’t have my keys, I carry <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5966XX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1" target="_blank">this 64GB credit card-shaped flash drive</a> in my wallet. It’s rarely used but there if needed.</p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Having a USB flash drive ensures secure access to digital files, software, and the internet. My setup handles about 99% of situations, giving me confidence. Storage is cheap, and everything I mentioned is free. If you don’t have an EDC flash drive, start now. Shoot me an email with any questions or comments and always, <b>STAY READY</b>.</p>
