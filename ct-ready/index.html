      <p class="headline-content">Hi, I'm CT.
      <br/>
      <br/>I'm a regular guy who likes to be ready for anything.
      <br/>
      <br/>I am not a prepper.
      <br/>
      <br/>I do not have a shipping container buried in my backyard with a five year supply of non-perishable food.
      <br/>
      <br/>I don't even have a backyard.
      <br/>
      <br/>I work in an office and live in a one bedroom apartment in the city.
      <br/>
      <br/>I have a wife, three dogs, and a baby on the way.
      <br/>
      <br/>I believe we can handle any situation, emergency or otherwise.
      <br/>
