    <h1>CT Ready</h1>
    <h2>Practical Preparedness</h2>
    <p>My name is CT and I'm a regular guy who likes to be ready for anything.
      <br/>
      <br/>I am not a prepper.
      <br/>
      <br/>I do not have a shipping container buried in my backyard with a five year supply of non-perishable food.
      <br/>
      <br/>I don't even have a backyard.
      <br/>
      <br/>I work in an office and live in a one bedroom apartment in the city.
      <br/>
      <br/>I have a wife, 3 dogs, and a baby on the way.
      <br/>
      <br/>I am confident that we can handle any situation emergency or otherwise.
      <br/>
      <br/>There are countless ways life can go wrong. The internet can go dark, power and water could be shut off, our currency could lose it's value, or any number of other inconveniences or catastrophes. While some things are more likely to occur than others, my goal is to always put my family in a position to be able to weather the storm of a disruption in our lives and to mitigate the damage done by those disruptions. By having a plan for food, power, protection, and information, I can make sure my family is ready to handle everything from a bug bite at the playground, to a collapse of our economy, and I dont have to break the bank or overhaul my family's lifestyle to do so. On this website I am documenting everything I know and everything I learn. I thank you for visiting and I hope this information helps you get you and your family ready for anything.
